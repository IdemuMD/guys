    <div class="article-content">
      <div class="article-text">
        <p>Norway is a country located in Northern Europe, bordering Sweden, Finland, and Russia. It is known for its stunning natural beauty, with fjords, mountains, and forests covering much of its land.</p>
        <p>The capital city of Norway is Oslo, which is home to many museums, galleries, and cultural institutions. The city is also known for its vibrant nightlife and shopping scene.</p>
        <p>Norway is famous for its fjords, which are long, narrow inlets of the sea that are flanked by steep cliffs. The Sognefjord, located in western Norway, is the longest and deepest fjord in the country.</p>
        <p>In addition to its natural beauty, Norway is also known for its rich cultural heritage. The country has a strong tradition of folk music, dance, and handicrafts, and many festivals and celebrations take place throughout the year.</p>
        <p>Norway is also famous for its Northern Lights, also known as the Aurora Borealis. The country is one of the best places in the world to see this natural phenomenon, which is caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with the Earth's magnetic field.</p>
        <p>The country has a strong economy, driven by its oil and gas industry, as well as its fishing and forestry industries. Norway is also a leader in renewable energy, with a goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2030.</p>
